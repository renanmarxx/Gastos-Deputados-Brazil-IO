# Gastos-Deputados-Brazil-IO

<b> UNDER DEVELOPMENT </b>

This repository surrounds a Data Engineering project which collects data provided by Portal da Transparência in Brazil about deputies expenses. The data is collected and disposed for use from [Brasil IO](https://brasil.io/home/), a non-profit organization which democratizes public data for the community.

It was created under a CI/CD pipeline gathering information from API sources, storing them into S3 buckets and ingesting the files onto Databricks Delta Tables.
